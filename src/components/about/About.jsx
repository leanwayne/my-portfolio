                <p>                   
                    I am a creative web developer who loves to code and solve new challenges.<br/>
                    I consider myself a kind, patient and very helpful person, 
                    ready to learn, work and develop the challenges that come my way with dedication and effort.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4>Objetives and expectations:</h4>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    My main goal is to formally introduce myself to the IT environment and scale over time as I acquire skills and learning.
                    I expect to start doing my work tasks in a team and collaborative environment.
